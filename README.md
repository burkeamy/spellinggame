# spellinggame
This is a hangman style game that was created to help my daughter with her spelling words. Words in the word list are spelling words from this year. Once the word is correctly guessed it is removed form the list. Incorrect guess remain in the list. It keeps track of your wins and losses. The cat image is there only to make it more cute and fun.

This game is made with HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript
