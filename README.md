# spellinggame
My daughter has entered the world of spelling words. I desgigned this site to help her study her words in a fun game environment. This site is currently a work in progress and still needs lots of work. It will also need to be updated each week with her new words.

This site is created using HTML5, CSS3 and javascript

Stay tuned for future updates :)
